## Project Structure

- **python-generators-0x00/**
  - Learn how to use Python generators for efficient data streaming and batch processing, especially with databases.
  - Includes scripts for streaming users, batch processing, lazy pagination, and seeding a MySQL database.

- **python-decorators-0x01/**
  - Explore Python decorators for logging, database connection management, transactions, retries, and caching.
  - Practice writing reusable and composable decorator functions for backend tasks.

- **python-context-async-perations-0x02/**
  - Dive into context managers and asynchronous operations in Python.
  - Work with database connections, execute queries asynchronously, and handle concurrent operations.

- **0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests/**
  - Master unit and integration testing using `unittest`, `parameterized`, and `mock`.
  - Learn to write robust tests for utility functions and API clients, including best practices for mocking and test parameterization.
